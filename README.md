# What's Next?!

You are the superb Product Manager that we all know you to be. You have a gotten a chance of a life time. You have gotten 40 mins time to present to the Product Directors on what's next. They have placed the following constraints:

1) Six weeks of the product team - 5 engineers (mobile, web, backend) and 1 designer.
2) You need to generate $100k of revenue in this Six week window, assuming a reasonable number of regular + pro users.
3) Think partnerships (your business model should cover the expenses).

## Output: Word Document / Memo

1) Memo that captures the strategic intent of what you are trying to do. Stress on what is success through metrics. Stress on how this is strategic to the core of the product.
2) Mockups 2-5 that bring out the element. Pay specific attention to learnability and the needs of regular + pro users.
3) Incremental plan + user stories for the engineers. Remember to plan it in such a way that motivates the engineering team. Remember to plan it in a way to experiement with the business model.

Remember you have only 40 mins to present and you need to leave time for Q&A. But also have a few things in the appendix if things come up.

## Products:
Pick any one of the following. Think enterprise:

1) Google Maps
2) Slack
3) Github
4) Excel
5) BHIM App
